              <p>Lining up content evenly with only HTML and CSS can prove to be pretty challenging. That's why another most commonly-used Bootstrap feature is their grid system. The grid system allows us to use several Bootstrap classes to quickly create a wide variety of invisible grids that neatly space and line up content.

                In this lesson, we'll explore how to implement this powerful feature in our own projects.
                
                The Bootstrap grid system contains just two parts: rows and columns. It is built on a powerful CSS concept known as the flexbox. The flexbox is a very important layout model for web designers, so if you have a specific interest in design, we recommend exploring it further on your own.</p>

              <p>The Russell family is a fictional family on the American soap opera Passions, which aired on NBC (1999–2007) and on DirecTV (2007–2008). Created by the soap's founder and head writer James E. Reilly, the family originally consisted of the married couple Eve and T. C. Russell and their children, Whitney and Simone. Later characters included Eve's vengeful adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne, Whitney's husband Chad Harris-Crane, Eve's aunt Irma Johnson, and Eve's child with Julian Crane, Vincent Clarkson, whose alter ego Valerie was played by Daphnée Duplaix (pictured). The cast was frequently nominated for NAACP Image Awards and featured prominently in a series of public service announcements for Black History Month in 2003. The show drew mixed critical attention for storylines involving Chad's affair with the intersex Vincent, but won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2006 for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality.
